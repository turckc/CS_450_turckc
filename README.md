## Software Dependencies
You will need to install the following manually:
- C++ compilers
- CMake
- Visual Code
- Vulkan SDK

The rest of the dependencies will be automatically fetched by CMake.

### C++ Compilers
* ***For Windows:*** Download and install ONE of the following:
  * [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (and install the C++ toolchain) ***(STRONGLY recommended if you are taking another class with me)***
  * [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe
  ) 
* ***For Linux:*** Install g++ compilers if not already installed.
* ***For Mac:*** The included Clang g++ compilers should be fine.

### CMake
You will need **version 3.24** or higher.

* ***For Windows:***
  * Download the CMake installer from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
  * If given the option, make sure to **"Add CMake to the system PATH for all users"**.
* ***For Mac:***
  * Download the latest "macOS 10.13 or later" .dmg from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
  * Install Cmake and run it
  * Select ```"Tools" -> "How to Install for Command Line Use"```
  * Copy the second option into a terminal: ```sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install```


### Visual Code
I strongly recommend Visual Code as your IDE.
* [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install Visual Code
  * I suggest enabling the context menu options.

- GLFW
- GLM
- Assimp
- vk-bootstrap
- VulkanMemoryAllocator (VMA)

***For Linux:*** Install the following:
